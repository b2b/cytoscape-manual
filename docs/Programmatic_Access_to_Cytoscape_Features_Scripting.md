# Cytoscape Automation

Cytoscape Automation is a collection of features that enable users to create workflows executed entirely within Cytoscape or by external tools (e.g., Jupyter, R, GenomeSpace, etc), and whose results are reproducible. This enables Cytoscape to scale to large collections of datasets and to larger more complex workflows than is practical via keyboard and mouse.

Cytoscape Automation exists in two skins â€“ the Commands interface and the Functions interface. Both can accomplish similar results, but are focused on different usage styles. Commands reprise user-initiated interactions (e.g., open session, import data, export image), whereas the Functions interface enables programmers to manipulate and operate on networks as internal Cytoscape data. Commands and Functions both call Cytoscape (and Cytoscape apps) via a REST interface known as CyREST.

This chapter describes how to produce custom workflows using CyREST natively and via Python and R interface libraries. More tutorials and examples are available at the [Cytoscape Automation web page (https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/wiki)](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/wiki).

Note that for a Cytoscape app to be callable via CyREST, the app must be installed into Cytoscape and the author must have
specifically added automation functionality to it. If there is
an app you would like to call, but which doesn't offer automation, please contact the app author and request that app functionality be 
added. Instructions for adding automation to an app are available on the [Cytoscape Automation web page (https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/wiki)](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/wiki).

## Programmatic Access to Cytoscape Features

In this chapter, you will learn how to use Cytoscape from the command
line and scripts. These features replace the ***Scripting*** module in
past versions of Cytoscape.

## Background

Cytoscape's intuitive graphical user interface is useful for
*interactive* network data integration, analysis, and visualization. It
provides great features for exploratory data analysis, but what happens
if you have hundreds of data files or need to ask someone to execute
your data analysis workflows? It is virtually impossible to apply the
same operations to hundreds of networks manually using a GUI. More
importantly, although you can save your ***results*** as session files,
you cannot save your ***workflows*** if you perform your data analysis
with point-and-click GUI operations. Cytoscape has several options that
support automating your workflows, all under the umbrella of Cytoscape Automation:

![CytoscapeAutomation_3.png](_static/images/ProgrammaticAccess/CytoscapeAutomation_3.png)

The **Commands** feature allows you to script a sequence of Cytoscape commands
and menu items, where commands can have parameter values that would
normally be provided by a user via a Cytoscape dialog box. For example,
*session open file="C:\\myfile.cys"* loads a session from a file
similarly to the **File | Open** menu item. Commands may 
resolve to Cytoscape core functions or automation-enabled apps installed in 
Cytoscape. You can create a command
script file that Cytoscape can execute via the **Tools | Execute Command
File** menu item or on the Cytoscape command line at startup. 

The CyREST API feature allows you to access Cytoscape from a separate
application, thereby orchestrating Cytoscape operations via HTTP-based REST calls. 
Cytoscape and apps can execute either Commands or Functions in this way.

Automation applications may be written in a general programming
language that keeps its own data structures, performs
complex flow control, or directly manipulates Cytoscape nodes, edges,
attributes, and visual styles. For R and Python, we provide language-specific
interface libraries (e.g., r2cytoscape and py2cytoscape) that present 
Cytoscape Automation in language-friendly terms, and call Cytoscape via 
the CyREST interface.

### Commands

![CommandTool.png](_static/images/ProgrammaticAccess/CommandTool.png)

***Commands*** is the built-in Cytoscape feature to automate your
workflow as simple script. You can learn more about Commands in the [Command Tool](Command_Tool.html#command-tool)
section.

### RESTful API

In some cases, you may need to use fully featured programming languages,
such as Python, R, Ruby, or
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
to script your workflow. Such languages enable complex control and data
structures, and Cytoscape would be called as a service. For such use
cases, accessing Cytoscape via REST API is the right option.

Cytoscape offers two flavors of REST-style control: REST Commands and
cyREST. REST Commands uses a REST interface to issue script commands.
cyREST uses a REST interface to access the Cytoscape data model as a
document via a formal API.

#### 1. REST API for Commands

In addition to running Command scripts, Command module has REST API to
enable command execution from another program.

By default, this feature is disabled. To enable the REST API server for
Commands, please follow these steps:

1.  Open a terminal session:

    -   [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell)
        or Command (For windows)

    -   Terminal or [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) (For Mac)

    -   Terminal (For Linux)

2.  Start Cytoscape from command-line. You must specify a TCP/IP port
    number as a parameter -- in this example, port 8888 will be opened
    for Command:

    -   For Mac/Linux

            ./cytoscape.sh -R 8888

        For Windows

            ./cytoscape.bat -R 8888

3.  To test the Command interface, open the following URL with your web
    browser:

    -   http://localhost:8888/v1/commands

4.  If you see list of available commands, you are ready to use Command
    API

#### 2. cyREST

![_static/images/ProgrammaticAccess/logo300.png](_static/images/ProgrammaticAccess/logo300.png)

**[cyREST](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cyrest) is a
language-agnostic, programmer-friendly RESTful API module for
Cytoscape**. If you want to build your own workflow with
[R](http://www.r-project.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) or
other programming languages along with Cytoscape, this is the option for
you. You can use popular tools, including IPython/Jupyter Notebook and
RStudio as your orchestration tool for your data visualization workflow
with Cytoscape.

![jupyter.png](_static/images/ProgrammaticAccess/jupyter.png)

(Sample [Jupyter
Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/idekerlab/py2cytoscape/blob/develop/examples/New_wrapper_api_sample.ipynb)
written with cyREST and
[py2cytoscape](https://github.com/idekerlab/py2cytoscape))

Currently, cyREST is available as an App for Cytoscape 3.2.1 and later,
and requires the Java 8 (or later) virtual machine. As of Cytoscape
v3.3, cyREST is installed automatically with Cytoscape. Please visit the
link below for more information.
